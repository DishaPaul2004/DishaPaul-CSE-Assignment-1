# Cloning a Photography website
## Introduction
I have cloned a photography/fashion website using HTML and CSS. I have also added on-hover effects and transitions to enhance the dynamic nature of the webpage.
## Output

At the beginning of the web page, there is a video which continuously plays along with the header of the page. There is no horizontal overflow in this webpage but since there is an amount of vertical overflow, a vertical scrollbar is present along the webpage.

The profiles in the webpage have been implemented as figures, each having its own image and caption. These profiles continuously move from right to left (marquee effect). Moreover, there is an on-hover effect on the alphabets and each time the user hovers on an alphabet, a circular border appears around it.

There is also a transition on the profiles mentioned in the 'Updates' section and they oscillate on hovering.

There is also a marquee effect on the words "Premier Models 2020" as they appear continuously from the right to left as well.
